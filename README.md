Automated Karyotyping using Deep Learning and Image Processing.

## Project Details
Karyotyping is a process of pairing and ordering human chromosomes depending on their size, position of the centromere and banding pattern.
It is used to analyse human chromosomes for various genetic disorders especially during prenatal screenings.\
Since, manual karyotyping is a labor intensive and a time-consuming task, developing automatic computer-assisted karyotyping system is required. The proposed Automated Karyotyping System  detects chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosome) from the microscopic image with the help of Faster RCNN with inception v2 model, classiÔ¨Åes them with the help of Two Step Classification approach using inception v3 model.
