## An Automated Karytyping using Deep Learning and Image Processing

## Details
- Karyotyping is a process of pairing and ordering human chromosomes depending on size, centromere position, and banding pattern.
- It is used to analyse human chromosomes for various genetic disorders  especially during prenatal screenings.
- Since, manual karyotyping is a labor intensive and a time consuming task, developing automatic computer-assisted karyotyping system is required. 
- The proposed Automated Karyotyping System  detects chromosomes from the microscopic image with the help of Faster RCNN with inception v2 model, 
classiÔ¨Åes them with the help of inception v3 model and with cytogenetic parameter like length of chromosome.
